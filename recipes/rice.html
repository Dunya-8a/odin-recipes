    <h5>Traditional Persian rice with safran</h6>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
        <li>1 large potato, cut into 0.7cm slices</li>
        <li>1 pinch saffron threads</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>1.5 cups of water</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of butter</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon parsley, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice to get the starch out.</li>
        <li>While doing that, bring the water to the boil, adding a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Add the rice and cook for 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Cover bottom of pot with 1 layer of potato slices. Sprinkle cumin and salt over potatoes. Cook until potatoes are sizzling, 2 to 3 minutes; top potatoes with rice to form an even layer. Reduce heat to low and place butter slices over rice.</li>
        <li>Top pot with a layer of clean paper towels and place lid over towels. Steam until rice is fluffy, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Grind saffron threads with a mortar and pestle. Mix crushed saffron with 1 1/2 tablespoons hot water in a large bowl. Add a couple spoonfuls of rice to saffron mixture and stir until rice is yellow.</li>
        <li>Spoon remaining rice into a serving bowl, top with saffron rice, and line edges of bowl with potatoes. Garnish with parsley.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
